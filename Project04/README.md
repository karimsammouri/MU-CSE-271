<h1>Checkers Game Desktop App</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

  JPanels, JFrames, ActionListeners, and MouseListeners. Final project submission for Miami University's 
  CSE 271: Object-Oriented Programming during the Spring 2020 semester. Implemented a functioning GUI despite it being 
  optional. Assigned requirements document is provided. This project is wholly designed and implemented by me with all rights
